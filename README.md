# random-password-maker
This app is a random password maker. Starter html and css was provided and I did not modify them at all. 
The user clicks the generate button in the browser window and is then given a series of prompts concerning the characteristics that they would like the password to have. The only restriction is that the password be between 8 and 128 characters. However, this restriction can easily be amended by changing one line of the JavaScript code. 
I have made comments on the JavaScript code because that is what I was responsible for. There were some starting variables and variable names and I have tried to keep them and, if they are different, it was an oversight. 
I broke up the different portions of the code into different functions and, thus, needed to have some global variables. However, as a result, many portions of the code can be modified to adjust the parameters of the password.
